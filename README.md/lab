# 🧠 ai-homelab-mistral-

A home lab AI assistant powered by **Mistral** and **Open WebUI**, deployed in a secure local environment using Docker and VirtualBox.

This project documents how to build, deploy, and run a containerized AI chatbot server locally — without relying on OpenAI, internet access, or cloud compute. It's designed for:
- 📦 Local-first AI experimentation
- 🔐 Self-hosted privacy
- 🧪 Infrastructure-as-Code learning
- 🛠️ Homelab builders & system integrators

---

## 📐 Architecture

![alt text](image.png)

> Mistral + Open WebUI run in a Docker container inside an Ubuntu-based VirtualBox VM. The host provides persistent storage, bridged networking, and CLI/GUI access. Optionally accessible to other local users (LAN).

---

## 🚀 Quick Deploy (with Docker)

Clone the repo and run the deploy script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JarrandyR/ai-homelab-mistral-.git

🙋 Why Use This?

You want a local ChatGPT-like assistant that runs 100% offline.

You're learning DevOps, infrastructure, Docker, or AI system integration.

You’re building a home server stack with modular services.

You’re into privacy-first tools with full control of the backend.

🔐 Notes on Security

Uses bridge networking by default to stay on local LAN.

No ports exposed to the internet unless changed manually.

You can add authentication via reverse proxy (NGINX, Traefik) — not included in this lab.
